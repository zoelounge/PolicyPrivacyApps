        <h2><strong>“Face Symmetry:nobody's perfect” - Privacy Policy</strong></h2>
        <p>
            I built the “Face Symmetry:nobody's perfect” (an Android app) as an Ad Supported app, as it uses
            <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites?hl=en">admob
                https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites?hl=en</a> from Google.
            This APP is provided by at no cost and is intended for use as is. This page is used to inform visitors
            regarding my policies with the collection, use,
            and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use my App. If you choose to use my App, then
            you agree to the collection and use of information in
            relation to this policy. The Personal Information that I may collect is used for providing and improving the
            App. I will not use or share your
            information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.
        </p>

        <strong>Information Collection and Use</strong>
        <p>
            I do not request you any personal information, nor any personal data is collected by me in any way.
            All data collected shall remain on the phone unless data used by third parties.
        </p>
        <strong>Third Party Services</strong>
        <p>
            The app does use third party services <a
                href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites?hl=en">(Admob advertising by Google)
                https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites?hl=en</a> that may collect information used to
            identify you.
            Their websites explain better how they, eventually, will use your data.
            In addition to the Services we provide directly, we also use third party service providers (collectively
            referred to as “Third Party Services”) who operate their own Privacy Policies (listed below) and may also
            provide options to\‘opt-out’of data
            collection.

            All the Third Party Services we use we trust and deem their services important into our effective operation.

            So you can find out more about the services we use, and in turn those you may use, whilst interacting with
            our Services, we are also providing information on what we use the services for and links to their
            associated Privacy Policies.
        </p>
